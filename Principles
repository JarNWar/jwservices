1.	All services are developed based on [Spring Boot 2.x]
2.	All services must be invoked by business service, we do not recommend invoke services directly (by client) although they can be.
3.	Because of the services are used for distributed architecture, so we must comply with CAP and BASE principles when designing and coding for a service.
4.	Every API must has a good performance(responding time <= 1s), of cause, the performance is effected by business service environment.
5.	Hold on, think twice. Cost more time to design, cost little bit time to develop.
